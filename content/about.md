## About Me

Hi there! I'm Toye, a tech enthusiast and problem-solver who loves to build things. My journey has taken me from hands-on IT support to developing serverless solutions and exploring the world of AI.

I'm a proud Master of Science in Cyber Forensics student with a passion for learning new things, from programming languages like Python and Go to cloud platforms like AWS. When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about space exploration or thinking about my next big project.

This blog is a personal lab where I share my thoughts, projects, and the lessons I learn along the way. I hope you find something interesting here!
