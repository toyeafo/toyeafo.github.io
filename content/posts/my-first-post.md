Welcome to my personal lab! This blog is a place to document and share my ongoing explorations, from my professional life in technology and engineering to my personal interests.

Here, you will find my thoughts on a range of topics, including:

- **My Journey into Tech**: I will be sharing my insights into cloud computing, building AI agents with tools like the Gemini API, and my hands-on experience with technologies like Python, Go, and Terraform.
- **Engineering and Space Exploration**: From my passion for electronics to the fascinating world of space engineering, I will explore these topics and their impact on our world.
- **Personal Wellbeing**: This blog will also serve as a space to discuss my personal journey in maintaining a healthy and balanced life, sharing lessons learned and reflections on the importance of wellbeing.

This is a space for me to think out loud, build in the open, and share my passion with others. I am excited to have you join me on this journey.
